# Python Package Exercise
![Python build & test](https://github.com/software-students-fall2024/3-python-package-thecoders2/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)

## Package Description

A Python package lets users select a category and sub-category to reveal two unique facts about it. One fact is true, while the other is a playful fabrication, and the user needs to identify the correct one. 

## Link to the package's page on the PyPI website

https://pypi.org/project/guessFact/

## How to install and use this package

Try installing and using this package in a separate Python project:

1. Create a `pipenv`-managed virtual environment and install the latest version of the package 
```
pip install pipenv
pipenv install guessFact
```
2. Activate the virtual environment
```
pipenv shell
```
3. Create a Python program file that imports the package and uses it, as shown in the [Example File](https://github.com/software-students-fall2024/3-python-package-thecoders2/blob/main/example.py).
4. Run the program (change the "program_filename" to the file name you created):
```
python3 program_filename.py
```
Try running the package directly:
1. Create and activate up the `pipenv` virtual environment as shown above
2. Run the package directly from the command line
```
python3 -m guessFact
```

## How to build and test the code

1. Clone this repository to the editor in your computer
2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies
```
pip install pipenv
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```
3. Run tests
```
python3 -m pytest
```
